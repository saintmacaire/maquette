== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I start? =

There is no options page. Just go to your Appearance > Widgets admin page and find the new Analog Clock widget. Add it to your sidebar and change settings if you want to see another than the default clock.

Other ways to integrate a clock into your site are shortcodes or a theme function. See instructions below.

= What options does the widget have? =

First of all, you can pick a preset skin. There are 21 skins made by other users and, when the Advanced extension is added, one Minimal skin that only shows the clock arms, that can be useful for placing over a custom background image.

There are these options:

- Custom skin parameters - see question below;
- Radius - changes the clock size;
- Hide second hand;
- Show digital time (more options in the Advanced version);
- Set digital time color;
- GMT Offset - use this if you want one or more clocks to show the time for other timezones;
- Scale - linear is our standard clock scale, the other two show a logarithmic time scale;
- Align - left, center or right;
- Subtext - optional text, centered below the clock.

Then there are extra options availabe in the [CoolClock - Advanced extension](https://premium.status301.net/downloads/coolclock-advanced/) which allow for more customisation:

- Background image - define the full URL or path to an image to serve as background;
- Repeat image;
- Background size - stretch or cover to make it match your clock size;
- Background position - center, top, right, bottom or left of the wrapping div (define div size below);
- Width and height - define the size of the wrapping div that holds the background image;
- Background color - define a color value in hex or rgb(a) format, or a css color name;
- Border radius - optional rounded corners, higher is rounder;
- Clock position relative to background - here you can position the clock relative to top and left border of the wrapping div (as defined above) that holds the background image.
- Custom skin parameters for shortcode

= How can I create a custom skin? =

Follow the steps on [Creating a Custom Skin](https://premium.status301.net/coolclock-custom-skin/) and if you


= Can I share this fantastic custom skin I created? =

If you made a nice skin and would like to share it, you can do so in the comments on [Creating a Custom Skin](https://premium.status301.net/coolclock-custom-skin/) or add it to your [Plugin Review](http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/coolclock).

Thanks for sharing! :)


= Can I insert a clock in posts or pages? =

Yes, there the shortcode **[coolclock** **/]** available. You can find all parameters on [How to use the CoolClock shortcode](https://premium.status301.net/how-to-use-the-coolclock-shortcode/).


= I'm building my own theme. Is there a theme function available? =

Yes, you can use a built-in WordPress function that parses a shortcode. To place the same clock as in the shortcode example above, anywhere in your theme, use this:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[coolclock skin="chunkySwiss" radius="140" showdigital=true align="left" /]'); ?>`


== Known Issues ==

1. When IE 8 is manually put or forced (through X-UA-Compatibility meta tag or response header) into Compatibility mode, the Clock will --even though the canvas area is put in place-- remain invisible.

2. When a shortcode is not placed on its own line but on the same line with text, image or even another shortcode, then the output (div with canvas tag) will be wrapped inside a paragraph tag. While most browsers do not have a problem displaying the clock, this *will* cause a validation error.

Please report any other issues on the [Support page](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/coolclock).


== Screenshots ==

1. Example analog clock in sidebar. The background logo is added with the [CoolClock - Advanced extension](https://premium.status301.net/downloads/coolclock-advanced/).
